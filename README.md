# POI FEED

## Overview

This application designed in this project will allow users to look for Point of Interests - POI in an easy and 
interactive way.

## Usage

The target users of the application would be people who are not satisfied with conventional travel advisory sources
such as *Tripadvisor*, *Lonely Planet*, *yelp*, and others.

Application users would be able to choose desired POI scrolling through TikTok - like feed.

##Personal interest

I came up with the idea for this project when I realized that each time I wanted to go somewhere - whether it was a
restaurant, museum, or a park I had to "research" possible options, going online and looking through various web.
I thought that it would be more fun to find places to visit scrolling through the feed.
